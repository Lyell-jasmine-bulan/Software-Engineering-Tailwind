            <p>The requirements for a system are the descriptions of what the system should do—
                the services that it provides and the constraints on its operation. These requirements
                reflect the needs of customers for a system that serves a certain purpose such as controlling a device, placing an order, or finding information. The process of finding
                out, analyzing, documenting and checking these services and constraints is called
                requirements engineering (RE).</p>
            <p>The term ‘requirement’ is not used consistently in the software industry. In some
                cases, a requirement is simply a high-level, abstract statement of a service that a system should provide or a constraint on a system. At the other extreme, it is a detailed,
                formal definition of a system function. Davis (1993) explains why these differences
                exist:

                    If a company wishes to let a contract for a large software development project,
                    it must define its needs in a sufficiently abstract way that a solution is not predefined. The requirements must be written so that several contractors can bid
                    for the contract, offering, perhaps, different ways of meeting the client organization’s needs. Once a contract has been awarded, the contractor must write a
                    system definition for the client in more detail so that the client understands and
                    can validate what the software will do. Both of these documents may be called
                    the requirements document for the system.

                    Some of the problems that arise during the requirements engineering process are
                    a result of failing to make a clear separation between these different levels of
                    description. I distinguish between them by using the term ‘user requirements’ to
                    mean the high-level abstract requirements and ‘system requirements’ to mean the
                    detailed description of what the system should do. User requirements and system
                    requirements may be defined as follows:
                </p>
            </section>
              
            <section>

                1.  User requirements are statements, in a natural language plus diagrams, of what
                    services the system is expected to provide to system users and the constraints
                    under which it must operate
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. System requirements are more detailed descriptions of the software system’s
                       functions, services, and operational constraints. The system requirements document (sometimes called a functional specification) should define exactly what is
                       to be implemented. It may be part of the contract between the system buyer and
                        the software developers.

                <p>
                    Different levels of requirements are useful because they communicate information about the system to different types of reader. Figure 4.1 illustrates the distinction
                    between user and system requirements. This example from a mental health care
                    patient management system (MHC-PMS) shows how a user requirement may be
                    expanded into several system requirements. You can see from Figure 4.1 that the
                    user requirement is quite general. The system requirements provide more specific
                    information about the services and functions of the system that is to be implemented.

                You need to write requirements at different levels of detail because different readers use them in different ways. Figure 4.2 shows possible readers of the user and system requirements. The readers of the user requirements are not usually concerned
                with how the system will be implemented and may be managers who are not interested in the detailed facilities of the system. The readers of the system requirements
                need to know more precisely what the system will do because they are concerned
                with how it will support the business processes or because they are involved in the
                system implementation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this chapter, I present a ‘traditional’ view of requirements rather than requirements in agile processes. For most large systems, it is still the case that there is a
                clearly identifiable requirements engineering phase before the implementation of
                the system begins. The outcome is a requirements document, which may be part of the
                system development contract. Of course, there are usually subsequent changes to
                the requirements and user requirements may be expanded into more detailed system
                requirements. However, the agile approach of concurrently eliciting the requirements as the system is developed is rarely used for large systems development.

                2. Non-functional requirements These are constraints on the services or functions
                    offered by the system. They include timing constraints, constraints on the development process, and constraints imposed by standards. Non-functional requirements often apply to the system as a whole, rather than individual system
                    features or services
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                In reality, the distinction between different types of requirement is not as clear-cut
                as these simple definitions suggest. A user requirement concerned with security,
                such as a statement limiting access to authorized users, may appear to be a nonfunctional requirement. However, when developed in more detail, this requirement
                may generate other requirements that are clearly functional, such as the need to
                include user authentication facilities in the system
            </p>
            <p>
                This shows that requirements are not independent and that one requirement often
                generates or constrains other requirements. The system requirements therefore do not
                just specify the services or the features of the system that are required; they also specify
                the necessary functionality to ensure that these services/features are delivered properly.

        <section>
            <p>
                The functional requirements for a system describe what the system should do. These
                requirements depend on the type of software being developed, the expected users of
                the software, and the general approach taken by the organization when writing
                requirements. When expressed as user requirements, functional requirements are
                usually described in an abstract way that can be understood by system users.
                However, more specific functional system requirements describe the system functions, its inputs and outputs, exceptions, etc., in detail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Functional system requirements vary from general requirements covering what
                the system should do to very specific requirements reflecting local ways of working
                or an organization’s existing systems. For example, here are examples of functional

            <h4>Domain requirements</h4>

            <p>Domain requirements are derived from the application domain of the system rather than from the specific
                needs of system users. They may be new functional requirements in their own right, constrain existing
                functional requirements, or set out how particular computations must be carried out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem with domain requirements is that software engineers may not understand the characteristics of
                the domain in which the system operates. They often cannot tell whether or not a domain requirement has
                been missed out or conflicts with other requirements.

                requirements for the MHC-PMS system, used to maintain information about patients
                receiving treatment for mental health problems:
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>1. A user shall be able to search the appointments lists for all clinics.</p>
            <p>2. The system shall generate each day, for each clinic, a list of patients who are
                    expected to attend appointments that da</p>
            <p>3. Each staff member using the system shall be uniquely identified by his or her
                    eight-digit employee number</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>These functional user requirements define specific facilities to be provided by the
                system. These have been taken from the user requirements document and they show
                that functional requirements may be written at different levels of detail (contrast
                requirements 1 and 3)
            </p>
            <p>Imprecision in the requirements specification is the cause of many software engineering problems. It is natural for a system developer to interpret an ambiguous
                requirement in a way that simplifies its implementation. Often, however, this is not
                what the customer wants. New requirements have to be established and changes
                made to the system. Of course, this delays system delivery and increases costs.
                For example, the first example requirement for the MHC-PMS states that a user shall
                be able to search the appointments lists for all clinics. The rationale for this requirement
                is that patients with mental health problems are sometimes confused. They may have an
                appointment at one clinic but actually go to a different clinic. If they have an appointment, they will be recorded as having attended, irrespective of the clinic.
                The medical staff member specifying this may expect ‘search’ to mean that, given
                a patient name, the system looks for that name in all appointments at all clinics.
                However, this is not explicit in the requirement. System developers may interpret the
                requirement in a different way and may implement a search so that the user has to
                choose a clinic then carry out the search. This obviously will involve more user input
                and so take longer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In principle, the functional requirements specification of a system should be both
                    complete and consistent. Completeness means that all services required by the user
                    should be defined. Consistency means that requirements should not have contradictory

                definitions. In practice, for large, complex systems, it is practically impossible to
                achieve requirements consistency and completeness. One reason for this is that it is easy
                to make mistakes and omissions when writing specifications for complex systems.
                Another reason is that there are many stakeholders in a large system. A stakeholder is a
                person or role that is affected by the system in some way. Stakeholders have different—
                and often inconsistent—needs. These inconsistencies may not be obvious when the
                requirements are first specified, so inconsistent requirements are included in the specification. The problems may only emerge after deeper analysis or after the system has
                been delivered to the customer.

                Non-functional requirements, as the name suggests, are requirements that are not
                directly concerned with the specific services delivered by the system to its users.
                They may relate to emergent system properties such as reliability, response time, and
                store occupancy. Alternatively, they may define constraints on the system implementation such as the capabilities of I/O devices or the data representations used in interfaces with other systems.

                Although it is often possible to identify which system components implement
                specific functional requirements (e.g., there may be formatting components that
                implement reporting requirements), it is often more difficult to relate components to
                non-functional requirements. The implementation of these requirements may be diffused throughout the system. There are two reasons for this:

                1. Non-functional requirements may affect the overall architecture of a system
                    rather than the individual components. For example, to ensure that performance
                    requirements are met, you may have to organize the system to minimize communications between components.

                2. A single non-functional requirement, such as a security requirement, may generate a number of related functional requirements that define new system services that
                    are required. In addition, it may also generate requirements that restrict existing
                    requirements.

                this diagram that the non-functional requirements may come from required characteristics of the software (product requirements), the organization developing the software (organizational requirements), or from external sources:

                1. Product requirements These requirements specify or constrain the behavior of the
                    software. Examples include performance requirements on how fast the system
                    must execute and how much memory it requires, reliability requirements that set
                    out the acceptable failure rate, security requirements, and usability requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Organizational requirements These requirements are broad system requirements
                    derived from policies and procedures in the customer’s and developer’s organization. Examples include operational process requirements that define how the system will be used, development process requirements that specify the programming
                    language, the development environment or process standards to be used, and environmental requirements that specify the operating environment of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. External requirements This broad heading covers all requirements that are
                    derived from factors external to the system and its development process. These
                    may include regulatory requirements that set out what must be done for the system to be approved for use by a regulator, such as a central bank; legislative
                    requirements that must be followed to ensure that the system operates within the
                    law; and ethical requirements that ensure that the system will be acceptable to
                    its users and the general public.

                Figure 4.4 shows examples of product, organizational, and external requirements
                taken from the MHC-PMS whose user requirements were introduced in Section 4.1.1.
                The product requirement is an availability requirement that defines when the system
                has to be available and the allowed down time each day. It says nothing about the
                functionality of MHC-PMS and clearly identifies a constraint that has to be considered by the system designers
            </p>
            <p>
                The organizational requirement specifies how users authenticate themselves to the
                system. The health authority that operates the system is moving to a standard authentication procedure for all software where, instead of users having a login name, they
                swipe their identity card through a reader to identify themselves. The external requirement is derived from the need for the system to conform to privacy legislation. Privacy
                is obviously a very important issue in healthcare systems and the requirement specifies
                that the system should be developed in accordance with a national privacy standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                A common problem with non-functional requirements is that users or customers
                often propose these requirements as general goals, such as ease of use, the ability of
                the system to recover from failure, or rapid user response. Goals set out good intentions but cause problems for system developers as they leave scope for interpretation
                and subsequent dispute once the system is delivered. For example, the following system goal is typical of how a manager might express usability requirements:

                    I have rewritten this to show how the goal could be expressed as a ‘testable’ nonfunctional requirement. It is impossible to objectively verify the system goal, but in
                    the description below you can at least include software instrumentation to count the
                    errors made by users when they are testing the system.

                Whenever possible, you should write non-functional requirements quantitatively
                so that they can be objectively tested. Figure 4.5 shows metrics that you can use to
                specify non-functional system properties. You can measure these characteristics

            <p>
                In practice, customers for a system often find it difficult to translate their goals
                into measurable requirements. For some goals, such as maintainability, there are no
                metrics that can be used. In other cases, even when quantitative specification is possible, customers may not be able to relate their needs to these specifications. They
                don’t understand what some number defining the required reliability (say) means in
                terms of their everyday experience with computer systems. Furthermore, the cost of
                objectively verifying measurable, non-functional requirements can be very high and
                the customers paying for the system may not think these costs are justified.
            </p>
            <p>
                Non-functional requirements often conflict and interact with other functional
                or non-functional requirements. For example, the authentication requirement in
                Figure 4.4 obviously requires a card reader to be installed with each computer
                attached to the system. However, there may be another requirement that requests
                mobile access to the system from doctors’ or nurses’ laptops. These are not normally
                equipped with card readers so, in these circumstances, some alternative authentication method may have to be allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is difficult, in practice, to separate functional and non-functional requirements
                in the requirements document. If the non-functional requirements are stated separately from the functional requirements, the relationships between them may be hard
                to understand. However, you should explicitly highlight requirements that are clearly
                related to emergent system properties, such as performance or reliability. You can do
                this by putting them in a separate section of the requirements document or by distinguishing them, in some way, from other system requirements.

            <p>
                A number of large organizations, such as the U.S. Department of Defense and the IEEE, have defined standards
                for requirements documents. These are usually very generic but are nevertheless useful as a basis for
                developing more detailed organizational standards. The U.S. Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers
                (IEEE) is one of the best-known standards providers and they have developed a standard for the structure of
                requirements documents. This standard is most appropriate for systems such as military command and control
                systems that have a long lifetime and are usually developed by a group of organizations.

                Non-functional requirements such as reliability, safety, and confidentiality
                requirements are particularly important for critical systems. I cover these requirements in Chapter 12, where I describe specific techniques for specifying dependability and security requirements.

            <h3>4.2 The software requirements document</h3>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                The software requirements document (sometimes called the software requirements
                specification or SRS) is an official statement of what the system developers should
                implement. It should include both the user requirements for a system and a detailed
                specification of the system requirements. Sometimes, the user and system requirements are integrated into a single description. In other cases, the user requirements
                are defined in an introduction to the system requirements specification. If there are a
                large number of requirements, the detailed system requirements may be presented in
                a separate document.
            </p>
            <p>
                Requirements documents are essential when an outside contractor is developing
                he software system. However, agile development methods argue that requirements
                change so rapidly that a requirements document is out of date as soon as it is written,
                so the effort is largely wasted. Rather than a formal document, approaches such as
                Extreme Programming (Beck, 1999) collect user requirements incrementally and
                write these on cards as user stories. The user then prioritizes requirements for implementation in the next increment of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                For business systems where requirements are unstable, I think that this approach
                is a good one. However, I think that it is still useful to write a short supporting document that defines the business and dependability requirements for the system; it is
                easy to forget the requirements that apply to the system as a whole when focusing on
                the functional requirements for the next system release.
            </p>
            <p>
                The requirements document has a diverse set of users, ranging from the senior
                management of the organization that is paying for the system to the engineers
                responsible for developing the software. Figure 4.6, taken from my book with Gerald
                Kotonya on requirements engineering (Kotonya and Sommerville, 1998) shows
                possible users of the document and how they use it.

                The diversity of possible users means that the requirements document has to be a
                compromise between communicating the requirements to customers, defining the
                requirements in precise detail for developers and testers, and including information
                about possible system evolution. Information on anticipated changes can help system designers avoid restrictive design decisions and help system maintenance engineers who have to adapt the system to new requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The level of detail that you should include in a requirements document depends on
                the type of system that is being developed and the development process used. Critical
                systems need to have detailed requirements because safety and security have to be analyzed in detail. When the system is to be developed by a separate company (e.g.,
                through outsourcing), the system specifications need to be detailed and precise. If an inhouse, iterative development process is used, the requirements document can be much
                less detailed and any ambiguities can be resolved during development of the system
            </p>
            <p>
                Figure 4.7 shows one possible organization for a requirements document that is
                based on an IEEE standard for requirements documents (IEEE, 1998). This standard
                is a generic standard that can be adapted to specific uses. In this case, I have
                extended the standard to include information about predicted system evolution. This
                information helps the maintainers of the system and allows designers to include support for future system features.
            </p>
            <p>
                Naturally, the information that is included in a requirements document depends
                on the type of software being developed and the approach to development that is to
                be used. If an evolutionary approach is adopted for a software product (say), the

                to decide how to meet the outline user requirements for the system.

            <p>
                The flexibility of natural language, which is so useful for specification, often causes problems. There is scope for
                writing unclear requirements, and readers (the designers) may misinterpret requirements because they have a
                different background to the user. It is easy to amalgamate several requirements into a single sentence and
                structuring natural language requirements can be difficult.

                to a fine level of detail. This means that the requirements documents are likely to be
                very long and should include most if not all of the chapters shown in Figure 4.7. For
                long documents, it is particularly important to include a comprehensive table of contents and document index so that readers can find the information that they need.

        <section>
            <p>
                Requirements specification is the process of writing down the user and system
                requirements in a requirements document. Ideally, the user and system requirements
                should be clear, unambiguous, easy to understand, complete, and consistent. In practice, this is difficult to achieve as stakeholders interpret the requirements in different
                ways and there are often inherent conflicts and inconsistencies in the requirements
            </p>
            <p>
                The user requirements for a system should describe the functional and nonfunctional requirements so that they are understandable by system users who don’t have
                detailed technical knowledge. Ideally, they should specify only the external behavior of
                the system. The requirements document should not include details of the system architecture or design. Consequently, if you are writing user requirements, you should not
                use software jargon, structured notations, or formal notations. You should write user
                requirements in natural language, with simple tables, forms, and intuitive diagrams
            </p>
            <p>
                System requirements are expanded versions of the user requirements that are used
                by software engineers as the starting point for the system design. They add detail and
                explain how the user requirements should be provided by the system. They may be
                used as part of the contract for the implementation of the system and should therefore be a complete and detailed specification of the whole system
            </p>
            <p>
                Ideally, the system requirements should simply describe the external behavior
                of the system and its operational constraints. They should not be concerned with how
                the system should be designed or implemented. However, at the level of detail
                required to completely specify a complex software system, it is practically impossible to exclude all design information. There are several reasons for this:

            <p>
                2. In most cases, systems must interoperate with existing systems, which constrain
                    the design and impose requirements on the new system.

            <p>
                3. The use of a specific architecture to satisfy non-functional requirements (such
                    as N-version programming to achieve reliability, discussed in Chapter 13) may
                    be necessary. An external regulator who needs to certify that the system is safe
                    may specify that an already certified architectural design be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                User requirements are almost always written in natural language supplemented
                by appropriate diagrams and tables in the requirements document. System
                requirements may also be written in natural language but other notations based on
                forms, graphical system models, or mathematical system models can also be
                used. Figure 4.8 summarizes the possible notations that could be used for writing
                system requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Graphical models are most useful when you need to show how a state changes or
                when you need to describe a sequence of actions. UML sequence charts and state
                charts, described in Chapter 5, show the sequence of actions that occur in response
                to a certain message or event. Formal mathematical specifications are sometimes
                used to describe the requirements for safety- or security-critical systems, but are
                rarely used in other circumstances. I explain this approach to writing specifications
                in Chapter 12.

            <h3>4.3.1 Natural language specification</h3>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                Natural language has been used to write requirements for software since the beginning
                of software engineering. It is expressive, intuitive, and universal. It is also potentially
                vague, ambiguous, and its meaning depends on the background of the reader. As a
                result, there have been many proposals for alternative ways to write requirements.
                However, none of these have been widely adopted and natural language will continue
                to be the most widely used way of specifying system and software requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                To minimize misunderstandings when writing natural language requirements,
                I recommend that you follow some simple guidelines:
            </p>

            <p>
                1. Invent a standard format and ensure that all requirement definitions adhere to
                that format. Standardizing the format makes omissions less likely and requirements easier to check. The format I use expresses the requirement in a single
                sentence. I associate a statement of rationale with each user requirement to
                explain why the requirement has been proposed. The rationale may also include
                information on who proposed the requirement (the requirement source) so that
                you know whom to consult if the requirement has to be changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Use language consistently to distinguish between mandatory and desirable
                    requirements. Mandatory requirements are requirements that the system must
                    support and are usually written using ‘shall’. Desirable requirements are not
                    essential and are written using ‘should’.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Use text highlighting (bold, italic, or color) to pick out key parts of the requirement
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Do not assume that readers understand technical software engineering language.
                    It is easy for words like ‘architecture’ and ‘module’ to be misunderstood. You
                    should, therefore, avoid the use of jargon, abbreviations, and acronyms.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Whenever possible, you should try to associate a rationale with each user
                    requirement. The rationale should explain why the requirement has been
                    included. It is particularly useful when requirements are changed as it may help
                    decide what changes would be undesirable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Figure 4.9 illustrates how these guidelines may be used. It includes two requirements for the embedded software for the automated insulin pump, introduced in
                Chapter 1. You can download the complete insulin pump requirements specification
                from the book’s web pages.

        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                Structured natural language is a way of writing system requirements where the
                freedom of the requirements writer is limited and all requirements are written in a
                standard way. This approach maintains most of the expressiveness and understandability of natural language but ensures that some uniformity is imposed on the
                specification. Structured language notations use templates to specify system
                requirements. The specification may use programming language constructs to
                show alternatives and iteration, and may highlight key elements using shading or
                different fonts
            </p>
            <p>The Robertsons (Robertson and Robertson, 1999), in their book on the
                VOLERE requirements engineering method, recommend that user requirements be
                initially written on cards, one requirement per card. They suggest a number of
                fields on each card, such as the requirements rationale, the dependencies on other
                requirements, the source of the requirements, supporting materials, and so on. This
                is similar to the approach used in the example of a structured specification shown
                in Figure 4.10.
            </p>
            <p>
                To use a structured approach to specifying system requirements, you define one or
            more standard templates for requirements and represent these templates as structured
            forms. The specification may be structured around the objects manipulated by the system, the functions performed by the system, or the events processed by the system. An
            example of a form-based specification, in this case, one that defines how to calculate the
            dose of insulin to be delivered when the blood sugar is within a safe band, is shown in
            Figure 4.10.

        <section>
            <p>
                When a standard form is used for specifying functional requirements, the following information should be included:
            </p>
            <p>1. A description of the function or entity being specified.</p>
            <p>2. A description of its inputs and where these come from.</p>
            <p>3. A description of its outputs and where these go to.</p>
            <p>
                4. Information about the information that is needed for the computation or other
                    entities in the system that are used (the ‘requires’ part).
            </p>
            <p>5. A description of the action to be taken</p>
            <p>
                6. If a functional approach is used, a pre-condition setting out what must be true
                    before the function is called, and a post-condition specifying what is true after
                    the function is called.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. A description of the side effects (if any) of the operation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using structured specifications removes some of the problems of natural language specification. Variability in the specification is reduced and requirements are
                organized more effectively. However, it is still sometimes difficult to write requirements in a clear and unambiguous way, particularly when complex computations
                (e.g., how to calculate the insulin dose) are to be specified.
            </p>
            <p>
                To address this problem, you can add extra information to natural language
                requirements, for example, by using tables or graphical models of the system. These
                can show how computations proceed, how the system state changes, how users interact with the system, and how sequences of actions are performed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tables are particularly useful when there are a number of possible alternative situations and you need to describe the actions to be taken for each of these. The insulin
                pump bases its computations of the insulin requirement on the rate of change of
                blood sugar levels. The rates of change are computed using the current and previous
                readings. Figure 4.11 is a tabular description of how the rate of change of blood
                sugar is used to calculate the amount of insulin to be delivered.

            <p>
                As I discussed in Chapter 2, requirements engineering processes may include four
                high-level activities. These focus on assessing if the system is useful to the business
                (feasibility study), discovering requirements (elicitation and analysis), converting
                these requirements into some standard form (specification), and checking that the
                requirements actually define the system that the customer wants (validation). I have
                shown these as sequential processes in Figure 2.6. However, in practice, requirements engineering is an iterative process in which the activities are interleaved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Figure 4.12 shows this interleaving. The activities are organized as an iterative
                process around a spiral, with the output being a system requirements document.
                The amount of time and effort devoted to each activity in each iteration depends on
                the stage of the overall process and the type of system being developed. Early in
                the process, most effort will be spent on understanding high-level business and

            <p>
                A feasibility study is a short, focused study that should take place early in the RE process. It should answer three
                key questions: a does the system contribute to the overall objectives of the organization? b) can the system be
                implemented within schedule and budget using current technology? and c can the system be integrated with
                other systems that are used?
                If the answer to any of these questions is no, you should probably not go ahead with the project.

                non-functional requirements, and the user requirements for the system. Later in the
                process, in the outer rings of the spiral, more effort will be devoted to eliciting and
                understanding the detailed system requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                This spiral model accommodates approaches to development where the requirements are developed to different levels of detail. The number of iterations around the
                spiral can vary so the spiral can be exited after some or all of the user requirements
                have been elicited. Agile development can be used instead of prototyping so that the
                requirements and the system implementation are developed together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people consider requirements engineering to be the process of applying a
                structured analysis method, such as object-oriented analysis (Larman, 2002). This
                involves analyzing the system and developing a set of graphical system models, such
                as use case models, which then serve as a system specification. The set of models
                describes the behavior of the system and is annotated with additional information
                describing, for example, the system’s required performance or reliability
            </p>
            <p>
                Although structured methods have a role to play in the requirements engineering
                process, there is much more to requirements engineering than is covered by these
                methods. Requirements elicitation, in particular, is a human-centered activity and
                people dislike the constraints imposed on it by rigid system models.
            </p>
            <p>
                In virtually all systems, requirements change. The people involved develop a better understanding of what they want the software to do; the organization buying the
                system changes; modifications are made to the system’s hardware, software, and
                organizational environment. The process of managing these changing requirements
                is called requirements management, which I cover in Section 4.7.

                    Requirements elicitation and analysis may involve a variety of different kinds of
                    people in an organization. A system stakeholder is anyone who should have some
                    direct or indirect influence on the system requirements. Stakeholders include endusers who will interact with the system and anyone else in an organization who will
                    be affected by it. Other system stakeholders might be engineers who are developing
                    or maintaining other related systems, business managers, domain experts, and trade
                    union representatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A process model of the elicitation and analysis process is shown in Figure 4.13.
                    Each organization will have its own version or instantiation of this general model
                    depending on local factors such as the expertise of the staff, the type of system being
                    developed, the standards used, etc
                </p>
                <p>The process activities are:</p>
                <p>
                    1. Requirements discovery This is the process of interacting with stakeholders of the
                    system to discover their requirements. Domain requirements from stakeholders and
                    ocumentation are also discovered during this activity. There are several complementary techniques that can be used for requirements discovery, which I discuss
                    later in this section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Requirements classification and organization This activity takes the unstructured collection of requirements, groups related requirements, and organizes
                    them into coherent clusters. The most common way of grouping requirements is
                    to use a model of the system architecture to identify sub-systems and to associate requirements with each sub-system. In practice, requirements engineering
                    and architectural design cannot be completely separate activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Requirements prioritization and negotiation Inevitably, when multiple stakeholders are involved, requirements will conflict. This activity is concerned with
                    prioritizing requirements and finding and resolving requirements conflicts
                    through negotiation. Usually, stakeholders have to meet to resolve differences
                    and agree on compromise requirements.

                    4. Requirements specification The requirements are documented and input into the
                    next round of the spiral. Formal or informal requirements documents may be
                    produced, as discussed in Section 4.3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Figure 4.13 shows that requirements elicitation and analysis is an iterative
                    process with continual feedback from each activity to other activities. The process
                    cycle starts with requirements discovery and ends with the requirements documentation. The analyst’s understanding of the requirements improves with each round of
                    the cycle. The cycle ends when the requirements document is complete.
                    Eliciting and understanding requirements from system stakeholders is a difficult
                    process for several reasons:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Stakeholders often don’t know what they want from a computer system except
                    in the most general terms; they may find it difficult to articulate what they want
                    the system to do; they may make unrealistic demands because they don’t know
                    what is and isn’t feasible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Stakeholders in a system naturally express requirements in their own terms and
                    with implicit knowledge of their own work. Requirements engineers, without
                    experience in the customer’s domain, may not understand these requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Different stakeholders have different requirements and they may express these
                    in different ways. Requirements engineers have to discover all potential sources
                    of requirements and discover commonalities and conflict.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Political factors may influence the requirements of a system. Managers may
                    demand specific system requirements because these will allow them to increase
                    their influence in the organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. The economic and business environment in which the analysis takes place is
                    dynamic. It inevitably changes during the analysis process. The importance of
                    particular requirements may change. New requirements may emerge from new
                    stakeholders who were not originally consulted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inevitably, different stakeholders have different views on the importance and priority of requirements and, sometimes, these views are conflicting. During the
                    process, you should organize regular stakeholder negotiations so that compromises
                    can be reached. It is impossible to completely satisfy every stakeholder but if some
                    stakeholders feel that their views have not been properly considered then they may
                    deliberately attempt to undermine the RE process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the requirements specification stage, the requirements that have been elicited
                    so far are documented in such a way that they can be used to help with requirements
                    discovery. At this stage, an early version of the system requirements document may
                    be produced with missing sections and incomplete requirements. Alternatively, the
                    requirements may be documented in a completely different way (e.g., in a spreadsheet or on cards). Writing requirements on cards can be very effective as these are
                    easy for stakeholders to handle, change, and organize.

            </section>

            <section>
                <p>
                    Requirements discovery (sometime called requirements elicitation) is the process of
                    gathering information about the required system and existing systems, and distilling
                    the user and system requirements from this information. Sources of information during the requirements discovery phase include documentation, system stakeholders,
                    and specifications of similar systems. You interact with stakeholders through interviews and observation and you may use scenarios and prototypes to help stakeholders understand what the system will be like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stakeholders range from end-users of a system through managers to external stakeholders such as regulators, who certify the acceptability of the system. For example,
                    system stakeholders for the mental healthcare patient information system include:
                </p>
                <p>1. Patients whose information is recorded in the system.</p>
                <p>2. Doctors who are responsible for assessing and treating patients.</p>
                <p>3. Nurses who coordinate the consultations with doctors and administer some
                treatments.</p>
                <p>4. Medical receptionists who manage patients’ appointments.</p>
                <p>5. IT staff who are responsible for installing and maintaining the system.</p>
                <p>
                    6. A medical ethics manager who must ensure that the system meets current ethical guidelines for patient care.
                </p>
                <p>7. Healthcare managers who obtain management information from the system.</p>
                <p>
                    8. Medical records staff who are responsible for ensuring that system information
                    can be maintained and preserved, and that record keeping procedures have been
                    properly implemented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to system stakeholders, we have already seen that requirements may
                    also come from the application domain and from other systems that interact with the
                    system being specified. All of these must be considered during the requirements
                    elicitation process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These different requirements sources (stakeholders, domain, systems) can all be
                    represented as system viewpoints with each viewpoint showing a subset of the

                    requirements for the system. Different viewpoints on a problem see the problem in
                    different ways. However, their perspectives are not completely independent but usually overlap so that they have common requirements. You can use these viewpoints
                    to structure both the discovery and the documentation of the system requirements.

                <h3>4.5.2 Interviewing</h3>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>
                    Formal or informal interviews with system stakeholders are part of most requirements engineering processes. In these interviews, the requirements engineering team
                    puts questions to stakeholders about the system that they currently use and the system to be developed. Requirements are derived from the answers to these questions.
                    Interviews may be of two types:
                </p>
                <p>1. Closed interviews, where the stakeholder answers a pre-defined set of questions.</p>
                <p>
                    2. Open interviews, in which there is no pre-defined agenda. The requirements
                    engineering team explores a range of issues with system stakeholders and hence
                    develop a better understanding of their needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In practice, interviews with stakeholders are normally a mixture of both of these.
                    You may have to obtain the answer to certain questions but these usually lead on to
                    other issues that are discussed in a less structured way. Completely open-ended discussions rarely work well. You usually have to ask some questions to get started and
                    to keep the interview focused on the system to be developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interviews are good for getting an overall understanding of what stakeholders do,
                    how they might interact with the new system, and the difficulties that they face with
                    current systems. People like talking about their work so are usually happy to get
                    involved in interviews. However, interviews are not so helpful in understanding the
                    requirements from the application domain.
                </p>
                <p>It can be difficult to elicit domain knowledge through interviews for two reasons:</p>
                <p>
                    1. All application specialists use terminology and jargon that are specific to a
                    domain. It is impossible for them to discuss domain requirements without using
                    this terminology. They normally use terminology in a precise and subtle way
                    that is easy for requirements engineers to misunderstand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Some domain knowledge is so familiar to stakeholders that they either find it
                    difficult to explain or they think it is so fundamental that it isn’t worth mentioning. For example, for a librarian, it goes without saying that all acquisitions are
                    catalogued before they are added to the library. However, this may not be obvious to the interviewer, and so it isn’t taken into account in the requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interviews are also not an effective technique for eliciting knowledge about organizational requirements and constraints because there are subtle power relationships
                    between the different people in the organization. Published organizational structures
                </p>

                <p>
                    rarely match the reality of decision making in an organization but interviewees may
                    not wish to reveal the actual rather than the theoretical structure to a stranger. In general, most people are generally reluctant to discuss political and organizational
                    issues that may affect the requirements.
                </p>
                <p>Effective interviewers have two characteristics:</p>
                <p>
                    1. They are open-minded, avoid pre-conceived ideas about the requirements, and
                    are willing to listen to stakeholders. If the stakeholder comes up with surprising
                    requirements, then they are willing to change their mind about the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. They prompt the interviewee to get discussions going using a springboard question,
                    a requirements proposal, or by working together on a prototype system. Saying to
                    people ‘tell me what you want’ is unlikely to result in useful information. They find
                    it much easier to talk in a defined context rather than in general terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Information from interviews supplements other information about the system from
                    documentation describing business processes or existing systems, user observations,
                    etc. Sometimes, apart from the information in the system documents, the interview
                    information may be the only source of information about the system requirements.
                    However, interviewing on its own is liable to miss essential information and so it
                    should be used in conjunction with other requirements elicitation techniques.

            <section>
                <p>
                    People usually find it easier to relate to real-life examples rather than abstract
                    descriptions. They can understand and criticize a scenario of how they might interact
                    with a software system. Requirements engineers can use the information gained
                    from this discussion to formulate the actual system requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scenarios can be particularly useful for adding detail to an outline requirements
                    description. They are descriptions of example interaction sessions. Each scenario
                    usually covers one or a small number of possible interactions. Different forms of
                    scenarios are developed and they provide different types of information at different
                    levels of detail about the system. The stories used in extreme programming, discussed in Chapter 3, are a type of requirements scenario.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A scenario starts with an outline of the interaction. During the elicitation process,
                    details are added to this to create a complete description of that interaction. At its
                    most general, a scenario may include:
                </p>
                <p>1. A description of what the system and users expects when the scenario starts.</p>
                <p>2. A description of the normal flow of events in the scenario.</p>
                <p>3. A description of what can go wrong and how this is handled.</p>
                <p>4. Information about other activities that might be going on at the same time.</p>
                <p>5. A description of the system state when the scenario finishes.</p>

                    Scenario-based elicitation involves working with stakeholders to identify scenarios and to capture details to be included in these scenarios. Scenarios may be written
                    as text, supplemented by diagrams, screen shots, etc. Alternatively, a more structured
                    approach such as event scenarios or use cases may be used.

                    used to enter data for a new patient (Figure 4.14). When a new patient attends a
                    clinic, a new record is created by a medical receptionist and personal information
                    (name, age, etc.) is added to it. A nurse then interviews the patient and collects medical history. The patient then has an initial consultation with a doctor who makes a
                    diagnosis and, if appropriate, recommends a course of treatment. The scenario
                    shows what happens when medical history is collected.

                    the actors involved in an interaction and names the type of interaction. This is then
                    supplemented by additional information describing the interaction with the system.
                    The additional information may be a textual description or one or more graphical
                    models such as UML sequence or state charts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use cases are documented using a high-level use case diagram. The set of use
                    cases represents all of the possible interactions that will be described in the system
                    requirements. Actors in the process, who may be human or other systems, are represented as stick figures. Each class of interaction is represented as a named ellipse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lines link the actors with the interaction. Optionally, arrowheads may be added to
                    lines to show how the interaction is initiated. This is illustrated in Figure 4.15, which
                    shows some of the use cases for the patient information system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no hard and fast distinction between scenarios and use cases. Some people consider that each use case is a single scenario; others, as suggested by Stevens
                    and Pooley (2006), encapsulate a set of scenarios in a single use case. Each scenario
                    is a single thread through the use case. Therefore, there would be a scenario for the
                    normal interaction plus scenarios for each possible exception. You can, in practice,
                    use them in either way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use cases identify the individual interactions between the system and its users or
                    other systems. Each use case should be documented with a textual description. These
                    can then be linked to other models in the UML that will develop the scenario in more
                    detail. For example, a brief description of the Setup Consultation use case from
                    Figure 4.15 might be:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setup consultation allows two or more doctors, working in different offices, to
                    view the same record at the same time. One doctor initiates the consultation by
                    choosing the people involved from a drop-down menu of doctors who are online. The patient record is then displayed on their screens but only the initiating
                    doctor can edit the record. In addition, a text chat window is created to help

                    Scenarios and use cases are effective techniques for eliciting requirements from
                    stakeholders who interact directly with the system. Each type of interaction can be
                    represented as a use case. However, because they focus on interactions with the system, they are not as effective for eliciting constraints or high-level business and nonfunctional requirements or for discovering domain requirements.

                <p>
                    The UML is a de facto standard for object-oriented modeling, so use cases and
                    use case–based elicitation are now widely used for requirements elicitation. I discuss
                    use cases further in Chapter 5 and show how they are used alongside other system
                    models to document a system design.

                <p>
                    Software systems do not exist in isolation. They are used in a social and organizational context and software system requirements may be derived or constrained by
                    that context. Satisfying these social and organizational requirements is often critical
                    for the success of the system. One reason why many software systems are delivered
                    but never used is that their requirements do not take proper account of how the social
                    and organizational context affects the practical operation of the system
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ethnography is an observational technique that can be used to understand operational processes and help derive support requirements for these processes. An analyst immerses himself or herself in the working environment where the system will
                    be used. The day-to-day work is observed and notes made of the actual tasks in
                    which participants are involved. The value of ethnography is that it helps discover
                    implicit system requirements that reflect the actual ways that people work, rather
                    than the formal processes defined by the organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People often find it very difficult to articulate details of their work because it is
                    second nature to them. They understand their own work but may not understand its
                    relationship to other work in the organization. Social and organizational factors that
                    affect the work, but which are not obvious to individuals, may only become clear
                    when noticed by an unbiased observer. For example, a work group may self-organize
                    so that members know of each other’s work and can cover for each other if someone
                    is absent. This may not be mentioned during an interview as the group might not see
                    it as an integral part of their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suchman (1987) pioneered the use of ethnography to study office work. She
                    found that the actual work practices were far richer, more complex, and more
                    dynamic than the simple models assumed by office automation systems. The difference between the assumed and the actual work was the most important reason why
                    these office systems had no significant effect on productivity. Crabtree (2003)
                    discusses a wide range of studies since then and describes, in general, the use of
                     ethnography in systems design. In my own research, I have investigated methods of

                    integrating ethnography into the software engineering process by linking it with
                    requirements engineering methods (Viller and Sommerville, 1999; Viller and
                    Sommerville, 2000) and documenting patterns of interaction in cooperative systems
                    (Martin et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2002; Martin and Sommerville, 2004).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ethnography is particularly effective for discovering two types of requirements:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Requirements that are derived from the way in which people actually work,
                    rather than the way in which process definitions say they ought to work. For
                    example, air traffic controllers may switch off a conflict alert system that
                    detects aircraft with intersecting flight paths, even though normal control
                    procedures specify that it should be used. They deliberately put the aircraft
                    on conflicting paths for a short time to help manage the airspace. Their control strategy is designed to ensure that these aircrafts are moved apart before
                    problems occur and they find that the conflict alert alarm distracts them from
                    their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Requirements that are derived from cooperation and awareness of other people’s
                    activities. For example, air traffic controllers may use an awareness of other
                    controllers’ work to predict the number of aircrafts that will be entering their
                    control sector. They then modify their control strategies depending on that predicted workload. Therefore, an automated ATC system should allow controllers
                    in a sector to have some visibility of the work in adjacent sectors
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ethnography can be combined with prototyping (Figure 4.16). The ethnography
                    informs the development of the prototype so that fewer prototype refinement cycles
                    are required. Furthermore, the prototyping focuses the ethnography by identifying
                    problems and questions that can then be discussed with the ethnographer. He or she
                    should then look for the answers to these questions during the next phase of the system study (Sommerville et al., 1993).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ethnographic studies can reveal critical process details that are often missed by
                    other requirements elicitation techniques. However, because of its focus on the
                    end-user, this approach is not always appropriate for discovering organizational or
                    domain requirements. They cannot always identify new features that should be
                    added to a system. Ethnography is not, therefore, a complete approach to elicitation on its own and it should be used to complement other approaches, such as use
                    case analysis.

                <h3>4.6 Requirements validation</h3>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>
                    Requirements validation is the process of checking that requirements actually define
                    the system that the customer really wants. It overlaps with analysis as it is concerned
                    with finding problems with the requirements. Requirements validation is important
                    because errors in a requirements document can lead to extensive rework costs when
                    these problems are discovered during development or after the system is in service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cost of fixing a requirements problem by making a system change is usually
                    much greater than repairing design or coding errors. The reason for this is that a
                    change to the requirements usually means that the system design and implementation must also be changed. Furthermore the system must then be re-tested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the requirements validation process, different types of checks should be
                    carried out on the requirements in the requirements document. These checks include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Validity checks A user may think that a system is needed to perform certain functions. However, further thought and analysis may identify additional or different
                    functions that are required. Systems have diverse stakeholders with different
                    needs and any set of requirements is inevitably a compromise across the stakeholder community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Consistency checks Requirements in the document should not conflict. That is,
                    there should not be contradictory constraints or different descriptions of the
                    same system function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Completeness checks The requirements document should include requirements
                    that define all functions and the constraints intended by the system user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Realism checks Using knowledge of existing technology, the requirements
                    should be checked to ensure that they can actually be implemented. These checks
                    should also take account of the budget and schedule for the system development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Verifiability To reduce the potential for dispute between customer and contractor, system requirements should always be written so that they are verifiable.
                    This means that you should be able to write a set of tests that can demonstrate
                    that the delivered system meets each specified requirement.

            <section>

                    There are a number of requirements validation techniques that can be used
                    individually or in conjunction with one another:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Requirements reviews The requirements are analyzed systematically by a team
                    of reviewers who check for errors and inconsistencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Prototyping In this approach to validation, an executable model of the system in
                    question is demonstrated to end-users and customers. They can experiment with
                    this model to see if it meets their real needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Test-case generation Requirements should be testable. If the tests for the
                    requirements are devised as part of the validation process, this often reveals
                    requirements problems. If a test is difficult or impossible to design, this usually
                    means that the requirements will be difficult to implement and should be reconsidered. Developing tests from the user requirements before any code is written
                    is an integral part of extreme programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should not underestimate the problems involved in requirements validation.
                    Ultimately, it is difficult to show that a set of requirements does in fact meet a user’s
                    needs. Users need to picture the system in operation and imagine how that system
                    would fit into their work. It is hard even for skilled computer professionals to perform this type of abstract analysis and harder still for system users. As a result, you
                    rarely find all requirements problems during the requirements validation process. It
                    is inevitable that there will be further requirements changes to correct omissions and
                    misunderstandings after the requirements document has been agreed upon.

                <p>
                    The requirements for large software systems are always changing. One reason for this is
                    that these systems are usually developed to address ‘wicked’ problems—problems that
                    cannot be completely defined. Because the problem cannot be fully defined, the software requirements are bound to be incomplete. During the software process, the stakeholders’ understanding of the problem is constantly changing (Figure 4.17). The system
                    requirements must then also evolve to reflect this changed problem view.

                   Once a system has been installed and is regularly used, new requirements inevitably
                    emerge. It is hard for users and system customers to anticipate what effects the new
                    system will have on their business processes and the way that work is done. Once endusers have experience of a system, they will discover new needs and priorities. There
                    are several reasons why change is inevitable: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. The business and technical environment of the system always changes after
                    installation. New hardware may be introduced, it may be necessary to interface
                    the system with other systems, business priorities may change (with consequent
                    changes in the system support required), and new legislation and regulations
                    may be introduced that the system must necessarily abide by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. The people who pay for a system and the users of that system are rarely the
                    same people. System customers impose requirements because of organizational
                    and budgetary constraints. These may conflict with end-user requirements and,
                    after delivery, new features may have to be added for user support if the system
                    is to meet its goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Large systems usually have a diverse user community, with many users having
                    different requirements and priorities that may be conflicting or contradictory.
                    The final system requirements are inevitably a compromise between them and,
                    with experience, it is often discovered that the balance of support given to different users has to be changed.
                </p>

                    Requirements management is the process of understanding and controlling
                    changes to system requirements. You need to keep track of individual requirements
                    and maintain links between dependent requirements so that you can assess the
                    impact of requirements changes. You need to establish a formal process for making
                    change proposals and linking these to system requirements. The formal process of
                    requirements management should start as soon as a draft version of the requirements
                    document is available. However, you should start planning how to manage changing
                    requirements during the requirements elicitation process.

                    Planning is an essential first stage in the requirements management process. The
                    planning stage establishes the level of requirements management detail that is
                    required. During the requirements management stage, you have to decide on:

            <p>1. Requirements identification Each requirement must be uniquely identified so
                that it can be cross-referenced with other requirements and used in traceability
                assessments.</p>
            <p>2. A change management process This is the set of activities that assess the impact
                and cost of changes. I discuss this process in more detail in the following section.</p>
            <p>3. Traceability policies These policies define the relationships between each requirement and between the requirements and the system design that should be recorded.
                    The traceability policy should also define how these records should be maintained.</p>
            <p>4. Tool support Requirements management involves the processing of large amounts
                   of information about the requirements. Tools that may be used range from specialist
                   requirements management systems to spreadsheets and simple database systems.</p>
            <p>Requirements management needs automated support and the software tools for
                this should be chosen during the planning phase. You need tool support for:</p>
            <p>1. Requirements storage The requirements should be maintained in a secure, managed data store that is accessible to everyone involved in the requirements engineering process.</p>
            <p>2. Change management The process of change management (Figure 4.18) is simplified if active tool support is available.</p>
            <p>
                3. Traceability management As discussed above, tool support for traceability
                allows related requirements to be discovered. Some tools are available which
                use natural language processing techniques to help discover possible relationships between requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                For small systems, it may not be necessary to use specialized requirements management tools. The requirements management process may be supported using the
                facilities available in word processors, spreadsheets, and PC databases. However,
                for larger systems, more specialized tool support is required. I have included links
                to information about requirements management tools in the book’s web pages.

                Requirements change management (Figure 4.18) should be applied to all proposed
                changes to a system’s requirements after the requirements document has been approved.

          <section>
            <p>
                using a formal process for change management is that all change proposals are treated
                consistently and changes to the requirements document are made in a controlled way.
                There are three principal stages to a change management process:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Problem analysis and change specification The process starts with an identified
                requirements problem or, sometimes, with a specific change proposal. During
                this stage, the problem or the change proposal is analyzed to check that it is
                valid. This analysis is fed back to the change requestor who may respond with a
                more specific requirements change proposal, or decide to withdraw the request.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Change analysis and costing The effect of the proposed change is assessed
                using traceability information and general knowledge of the system requirements. The cost of making the change is estimated both in terms of modifications to the requirements document and, if appropriate, to the system design and
                implementation. Once this analysis is completed, a decision is made whether or
                not to proceed with the requirements change.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Change implementation The requirements document and, where necessary, the
                system design and implementation, are modified. You should organize the
                requirements document so that you can make changes to it without extensive
                rewriting or reorganization. As with programs, changeability in documents is
                achieved by minimizing external references and making the document sections
                as modular as possible. Thus, individual sections can be changed and replaced
                without affecting other parts of the document.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a new requirement has to be urgently implemented, there is always a temptation to
                change the system and then retrospectively modify the requirements document. You
                should try to avoid this as it almost inevitably leads to the requirements specification and
                the system implementation getting out of step. Once system changes have been made, it
                is easy to forget to include these changes in the requirements document or to add information to the requirements document that is inconsistent with the implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Agile development processes, such as extreme programming, have been designed
                to cope with requirements that change during the development process. In these
                processes, when a user proposes a requirements change, this change does not go
                through a formal change management process. Rather, the user has to prioritize that
                change and, if it is high priority, decide what system features that were planned for the
                next iteration should be dropped.

            <p>
                ■ Requirements for a software system set out what the system should do and define constraints
                on its operation and implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
                ■ Functional requirements are statements of the services that the system must provide or are
                descriptions of how some computations must be carried out.
            </p>
            <p>
                ■ Non-functional requirements often constrain the system being developed and the development
                process being used. These might be product requirements, organizational requirements, or
                external requirements. They often relate to the emergent properties of the system and therefore
                apply to the system as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                ■ The software requirements document is an agreed statement of the system requirements. It
                should be organized so that both system customers and software developers can use it.
            </p>
            <p>
                ■ The requirements engineering process includes a feasibility study, requirements elicitation and
                analysis, requirements specification, requirements validation, and requirements management.
            </p>
            <p>
                ■ Requirements elicitation and analysis is an iterative process that can be represented as a spiral
                of activities—requirements discovery, requirements classification and organization,
                requirements negotiation, and requirements documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                ■ Requirements validation is the process of checking the requirements for validity, consistency,
                completeness, realism, and verifiability.
            </p>
            <p>
                ■ Business, organizational, and technical changes inevitably lead to changes to the requirements
                for a software system. Requirements management is the process of managing and controlling
                these changes.

                Once a destination has been selected, users are requested to input their credit card. Its
